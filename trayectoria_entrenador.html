            <p>It was not long after he retired until he returned to football but this time off the field, he began in the 1984-1985 season as Ajax sporting director. 
            Since he began as a sports director, he always had very clear ideas, which are to have a very offensive football, and to work to take care of the club's inferiors, and thus began a long-term sports project.</p>
            <p>And since he started this project in 1985, he signed as coach of the Ajax first team, even without having a coaching license. He was directing Ajax for 2 seasons 
            in which he showed a very attractive football in which his main virtue was in the offensive part and in the possession of the ball, with a formation made up of 3 defenders, 4 midfielders and 3 forwards. 
            At this stage in Ajax he won 2 knvb cups and 1 European Cup Winners' Cup and was named the best coach in the world according to World Soccer Magazine.</p>
            <p>On May 4, 1988, he had his second stage in Barcelona this time as a coach, and in the same way as as a player, he arrived and met a club in a sporting crisis, he met a club in which the president of that moment Jose Luis Nuñez, 
            had all the players against and asked for his resignation. And so Cruyff began a long-term project in Barcelona, ​​in the club he decided to sell a large part of that squad that asked the president to resign and making signings such as Txiki Begiristain or José Mari Bakero.</p>
            <p>During his first two seasons at the club he could only win one UEFA Cup Winners' CupAbove all, he focused on the team adopting his philosophy of a more offensive football and possession of the ball, which is the most important thing for a team.</p>
            <p>After these first seasons Cruyff was close to being dismissed by President Nuñez, in the 1990-1991 season the winning era of Johan Cruyff's Barcelona began, known as the Dream team, first winning the league this season and in 1991- 1992 won the most important title at the club level 
            the European Cup, the first European Cup in the club's history against Sampdoria at Wembley, with a goal from Ronald Koeman. Cruyff's words are always remembered before playing, which were:”Salid y disfrutad” (come out and enjoy).</p>
            
          </div>

      </div>
      <p>Then in the next two seasons he won 2 more leagues, 4 in a row, and managed to reach another final of the European Cup, against Milan in Athens, although this time losing 4-0. And here ends the cycle of the Dream Team players.</p>
      <p>In the following season a renovation began in Barcelona, ​​with young homegrown players, such as Josep Guardiola, Alberte Ferrer and other players with Ivan de la Peña, Oscar and Roger Garcia, many of them later were technicians who are followers of Cruyff's idea.</p>
      <p>In the 1995-1996 season with the signing of Luis Figo, they began to ask Cruyff for immediate results, but in the end the results did not arrive, losing the Copa del rey, the European Cup in the semifinals.</p>
      <p>And Cruyff and President Nuñez and Vice President Gaspart also began to have problems. In the absence of two days before the end of the league, a discussion between Cruyff and Gaspart caused Cruyff to be fired as Barcelona coach. For this reason, he later went on to be against Nuñez, 
      supporting a motion of censure, led by Joan Laporta. He was also against the next president Gasparta, former vice president of Nuñez.</p>
      <p>But Cruyff was not just another coach, he left a great mark in Barcelona, ​​being probably the most important person in the future successes of Barcelona, ​​leaving an idea of ​​the game, and inspiring many other technicians, who later some were able to triumph in Barcelona with Cruyff's ideas.</p>
      <p>In 2009 he decided to lead a team again, this time to the Catalan national team. Debuting with a 4-2 victory against Argentina. In 2012 he decided to retire as a coach.</p>
