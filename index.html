          <p>Hendrik Johannes "Johan" Cruyff was a dutch soccer player and coach, he was born on 25 April 1947 in Amsterdam, The son of a modest Dutch family, when he was 10 years old, he entered the Ajax academy in Amsterdam, 
          a club in which he debuted at the age of 17 on November 15, 1964, where he played with the mythical number 14, club in which he was until 1973.
          On April 25, 2007, the Ajax board removed the shirt with the number 14, in tribute to Cruyff, on the occasion of his 60th birthday.</p>
          <p>After his great time at Ajax he was signed by FC Barcelona of Spain in which he was for 5 seasons, where he also became an idol. Where I win 1 league and a cup.</p>
          <p>Then in 1978 he went to the United States championship. He played for Los Angeles Aztecas and the Washington Diplomats. In 1981 he returned to Netherlands. He won two more leagues with Ajax, and one with Feyenoord, in 1984. 
          He also had a fleeting stint at the Spanish Levante, which did not bring him greater glory.</p>
          <p>In the Netherlands team he was decisive and marked an era. In 1974, with Cruyff as the leader, the Dutch national team (nicknamed the clockwork orange for its forcefulness and the color of the jersey) became world runners-up with an astonishing game. 
          The basis of the Dutch team were the players and the Ajax system, the famous total football that Romanian coach Stefan Kovacs had imposed at the Amsterdam club in the early 1970s.</p>
          <p>After his great career as a footballer, Johan retired from football and joined Ajax Amsterdam as a coach, where he won two cups in 1986 and 1987. After his time at Ajax, he had his second stage, this time as a coach at FC Barcelona, 
          ​​which was where he promoted a showy game as a coach, based on ball possession and offensive spirit. This is his best known step, where he won some of the most important titles in his career and in the history of the club.</p>
          <p>Despite his extraordinary triumphs, the team's mismanagement in 1996 prompted the board to remove him from his post. Cruyff immediately appealed the decision to the courts, considering it unfair dismissal. 
          Cruyff's confrontation with the Barça leadership was not reflected in the fans, who always expressed their support for the former player and former coach who had given so many titles to his team.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of December 2012, Chivas de Guadalajara ended its relationship with coach Johan Cruyff because the work objectives that had been established since the beginning of the contractual relationship were not achieved.</p>
