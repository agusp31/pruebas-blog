          <h2>Cruyffism</h2>
        <div class="row">

            <p>Despite being fired as Barcelona coach, he continued to be an important person in the FC Barcelona environment, especially together with Joan Laporta, first supporting him in his motion of censure to the president at that time, which was Gaspart. 
              And when Joan Laporta became president of Barcelona, ​​Cruyff was always an advisor, and the person Laporta turned to to make an important decision for the club.</p>
            <p>But why is the figure of Johan Cruyff so important for FC Barcelona?</p>
            <p>During his time as a coach, Johan Cruyff arrived with a philosophy of the game that changed Barcelona, ​​in every way, and was the most important person in the history of Barcelona. This philosophy is based on playing offensive football and being a team that dominates the game through the ball, 
            having possession of the ball. Also using this philosophy in the lower categories of the club, which helps the younger players adapt faster to the first team since they are taught this philosophy, of wanting to be an offensive and dominating team.</p>
          </div>
        <p>First as a coach, it took him a couple of years to get the team to play well and have the results, so he won 4 consecutive leagues, 1 European Cup. But in 1994 he began to have problems with the dressing room, especially because Laudrup for the very high salary that he asked for Barcelona and that Cruyff did not want since it unbalanced the dressing room, 
          since everyone was going to start asking for more salary. This is how Barcelona began to decline and Núñez decided to kick Johan Cruyff out in 1996, starting a rivalry between the Barcelona fans, as some wanted Cruyff and others agreed to kick him out.</p>
        <p>Despite being fired, he remained close to the club, with Joan Laporta, supporting him in the motion of censure against Gaspart, and then being an advisor when Joan Laporta became president of the club. And I make fundamental decisions for the history of Barcelona, ​​first when Laporta came to the presidency, Barcelona came from being very far from titles, 
          playing in the Europa League, and without a sporting identity. The first thing he did was follow the recommendation of Cruyff and signed Frank Rijkaard as coach to start a new project. The first half of the season did not start well for Barcelona, ​​and it was very far from the first, which was Real Madrid.</p>
        <p>Joan Laporta had a very important decision to make, follow Cruyff's advice and keep Rijkaard, or follow the advice of his vice-president Sandro Rosell. Laporta decided to keep Rijkaard and sign Edgar Davids, Barcelona finished runner-up in the league that season, and then won 2 leagues in a row, a UEFA Champions League.</p>  
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>In the 2008/2009 season, Laporta had another very important decision, Rijkaard's cycle had already ended, due to problems in the dressing room with stars like Ronaldinho or Deco. At that time he also had to decide whether to sign Mourinho, a completely different coach in the style of Barcelona, ​​and who also came from winning all the important tournaments with Porto. Or bet on Josep Guardiola, 
            the Barcelona B coach, who played in the 3rd division. Again, he followed Cruyff's advice and bet on Guardiola.</p>
            <p>The first thing Guardiola did was take out the players with whom Rijkaard had problems, I bet on Cruyff's philosophy, and that Barcelona won all the titles that season, all 6 titles, playing impressive football, humiliating the maximum rival, beating Real Madrid 6-2. Again a great success from Joan Laporta and Johan Cruyff.
              Even unfortunately, the Barcelona partners voted for Sandro Rosell, someone with whom Laporta had problems before, since he was not someone who trusted this philosophy. This president removed Cruyff from Barcelona, ​​taking away that symbolic title of advisor, which he had with Laporta.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4">
            <img src="imagenes/cruyff-guardiola.jpg" class="w3-image">

          </div>
          <p>This happened in the 2010/2011 season, that year Barcelona won the league and the UEFA Champions League, with Guardiola. That he only endured 2 more years, and saw that he no longer had the support of the presidency, since they signed him players that he did not want, they took out players that he did want. For which he left Barcelona in the 2012/2013 season.</p>
          <p>Then there were 2 difficult years in which they continued to win due to the heritage left by Guardiola, young players, and some of the best in the world. Until in 2015, after a bad season for Gerardo Martino, it was decided to bet on Luis Enrique, a former Barcelona player, who spent a few years at Barcelona B. A coach who brought the idea of ​​Cruyff back to Barcelona , in his first year, he won all 3 major titles.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <img src="imagenes/cruyff_.jpg" class="w3-image">

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>At the end of that season there was another fundamental moment, elections for the presidency of Barcelona, ​​Joan Laporta ran again, and his greatest rival was Bartomeu. Johan Cruyff warned before the elections that if Laporta did not win, Barcelona would do very badly. Bartomeu won, and Cruyff in the end was right since this president was from 2015 to 2021, and Barcelona was left in financial and sporting ruin, 
              since he let the players rule in the locker room and the coach lost power. Doing the opposite of what Cruyff had taught Barcelona all the previous years.</p>
              <p>The importance of Cruyff was very great, as a player, as a coach, and from outside the field it was also important, from my opinion, if it weren't for Cruyff and his philosophy, Barcelona would not be the great team it is today. And despite dying 5 years ago, he is still a very important person, and his ideas continue to inspire coaches today.</p>
