        <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>Johan Cruyff played football since his childhood, with 10 years he was selected to be part of the lower categories of Ajax Amsterdam.
        His coach and one of his great mentors Rinus Michels prepared a physical exercise program for Johan, which was specially made to develop his frail complexion, in order for him to be able to withstand the rigors of a professional career. 
        Within Ajax he went through all his lower categories until at the age of 17 he was able to make his debut with the Ajax first team on November 15, 1964.</p>
        <p>Rinus Michels soon started employing his own brand of football philosophy called Total Football; in essence, this tactic allows any outfield player to take over the role of his teammates. This unique 
        philosophy was groundbreaking for its time, and no player has ever embodied it better than Johan Cruyff.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
          <p>Cruyff rose to glory in the 1965-66 season, leading Ajax to a league championship as he scored 25 goals in 23 matches. The following season, he went on to lead Ajax to a double, winning both the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup, as he finished as the league’s top scorer with 33 goals. 
            That period marked the beginning of the golden era of Total Football.</p>
          <p>Johan played in Ajax until 1972,  since his debut in 1964, he won 6 Eredivise, 4 KNVB cup, and he was an important part of the great Ajax won 3 european cups (currently known as UEFA Champions league), 1 international cup and 1 european supercup.
            During his stint in Ajax, Johan Cruyff played 319 matches (counting all tournaments) and scored a total of 250 goals.</p>
          <p>At the Ajax he became world class football icon, winning 1 golden ball (Balon D´or) in a Ajax and 2 golden ball in FC Barcelona, and award given by the France football magazine, awarded to the best player in Europe, he won this trophy in 1971, 
            and twice more while playing for the Barcelona team in 1973 and 1974. </p>
  
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <p>After some problems with management of Ajax, he was sold to FC Barcelona, becoming the signing most expensive in football history, at that time for 60 million pesetas.
              </p>
              <p>In Barcelona he was received as an idol, and with all the illusion since he had been the best European player the previous year at Ajax and had just won 3 consecutive European cups. 
                Besides that Barcelona was not going through a great moment and had been for 14 years without winning a league.
              </p>
              <p>Johan made his debut in 1973, against Granada, in this match he scored 2 goals, Barcelona won 4-0 this match. In his first season Cruyff scored 16 goals in 26 matches. 
                This first season he made history, winning La Liga (Spanish league) 1973/1974, after 14 years.
              </p>
              <p>In the following 2 seasons in Barcelona he could not win any other title, but he continued to be the star of the team. 
                During these years he had some problems with the FC Barcelona coach.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
               <div class="w3-container">

               </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>In his last season in Barcelona in 1978, he managed to win Copa del Rey, scoring 11 goals in all competitions. But after problems with the board, 
            he left FC Barcelona, becoming a club legend, scoring 50 goals in 180 games.</p>
            <p>After leaving Barcelona, he did not play football for a while, at the age of 30 he went to play in the North American Soccer League, first in 
              Los Angeles Aztecs, in which he spent 1 season and scored 14 goals in 27 games.</p>
              <p>Then he went to the Washington Diplomats, in which he spent 2 seasons, in which he scored 12 goals in 32 games. Between his two seasons at the Washington Diplomats, 
                he played 10 games for Levante UD in the second Spanish league.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>When it seemed that his football career was ending, Johan decided to return to the club of his childhood, Ajax, with 34 years, during this stage that lasted 2 seasons, 
              he won the league in both seasons and a cup, in this second stage in the club Johan played 52 games and scored 20 goals.</p>
            <p>During his last season in Ajax, Johan suffered the loss of what for him was his second father, the Ajax field caretaker, for this reason in his last season in Ajax, 
              he was in a low mood, for which the president believed that his career was over, and he decided not to renew his contract.</p>
            <p>For this reason, he decided to go to a direct rival of Ajax, Feyenoord, in which he won the league and the cup, and was chosen as the best player in the Eredivise. </p>
              <p>And so one of the best players in the history of football retired.</p>
         </div>
       </div>
       <h3>Netherlands national team</h3>
